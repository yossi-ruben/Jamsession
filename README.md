The purpose of this Web Application is to allow people to connect and collaborate on music accross the world.

## Problem to Solve
 Jamsession was built by musicians for musicians. The issue reveals itself when a musician wants to create a song but does not play all the required instruments. Jamsession allows a user to upload a song and put out a request for other musicians to collaborate on that song and add the required instruments. The song creator is then able to view all uploaded tracks to the master track and select which tracks to pull down and mix into the master track.
